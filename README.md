This cortical modeling coursework simulates the coupling of two LIF neurons, each one exciting the other one with first the same, then different weights, followed by the calculation of their firing rates in both conditions. 

The coursework additionally simulates the coupling of three neurons following a provided sceheme and plots the membrane potential of all neurons.
